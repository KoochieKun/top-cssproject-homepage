            Preschool of the Arts offers children from birth to five years old a child-centered, hands-on, social learning experience that emphasizes Jewish values, traditions and the arts. Our infant program is influenced by the RIE (Resources for Infant Educarers) approach that focuses on respectful care of babies, creating loving routines of sleeping, feeding, diapering and exploring. The preschool program, which serves children two to five years old, takes inspiration from the Reggio Emilia approach that honors children’s interests and ideas through emergent curriculum and sees documentation as a window onto the learning. We value children’s play and expression through the arts as a window onto their deepest selves.
